## Assignement 1 (Command Line text game):

### Installation

Execute `npm install` in the Assignment_1 folder to install the dependencies.

### Start

`node index.js` to start the game

### Editing code

- ROOMS can be deleted/added/edited.
Exits should be added using the EXIT class.
Rooms need to be connected using the setConnections method.
The starting room should be pushed into the world array first.
All the rooms should be pushed into the world array.

- ENEMIES can be edited/deleted/added.
Make sure to place them in the room of your choice.

- PLAYER can be only edited! Do NOT delete/rename the player object.

## Assignment 2 (Dynamic page, HTML DOM):
 
  
   - Use this link to load the page: https://wellybelly.github.io/OOBP/Assignment_2/
   
  OR
  
   - Download/Clone the repo and run the web page from a web server, due to browser security restrictions the JSON file cannot be accessed otherwise.
   A simple way to do it:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed and then install a development server
   
    npm install -g http-server
    
   - Then (from your terminal/console) go to the directory with the code/web page and run
   
    http-server
   - Then you will see a list of IPs which can be used to access that server. As far as I know this is a purely local server so you don't neet to worry.
   To stop the server simply hit CTRL + C in the terminal/console and the server is stopped.
